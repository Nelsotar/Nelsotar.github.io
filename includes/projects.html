        <h3>Posey Picks 2</h3>
        <p>The second game in the Posey Picks choose-your-own adventure game series. 
          This game was much more complicated than Posey Picks 1 since it was much larger, 
          incorporated new mini-games, and secret endings.

        <h3>Maze Solving Robot</h3>
        <p>A maze-solving robot made with JavaFX and <a href="https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring06/cps001/doc/becker/becker/robots/package-summary.html" target="_blank">becker.robots</a>.
          Originally it was a robot that simply crawled through the entire maze
          until it found the correct location. I then modified it so there were two
          robots: an invisible first robot that acted as a “probe” where it explored
          the maze and created a list of directions to get to the destination directly,
          and a secondary visible robot that followed the directions collected by the
           probe.
         </p>
         <p>
           I then created a GUI that a user could use to input maze size and
           the coordinates they would like the robot to navigate to. The GUI and the
           maze/robot are run in separate threads so they can run concurrently.

        <h3>The n Queens Problem</h3>
        <p>A program/GUI I made for solving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle" target="_blank">n Queens problem</a> and displaying its solutions.
          I originally created this to solve the problem with just 8 queens on one 8 x 8 board, but then I decided I wanted to expand it to include
           different board sizes. As of now it includes boards from 4 x 4 to 12 x 12 with queens to match. The positions
            included are all possible positions – not just fundamental positions.
