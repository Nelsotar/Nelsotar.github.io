          “Creativity is intelligence having fun.” Though some may stereotype development 
          as a profession lacking in creativity, I would strongly disagree. It is constantly 
          rolling with the punches and looking at things in novel ways to build solutions, 
          sometimes to problems we did not even know we had.

        As a fourth semester Systems Analyst student at Sheridan College, the more I learn, the more I can 
        tie together my ample creativity, technical skills, passion, and work ethic in complex and interesting
         ways. I look forward to taking this combination with me wherever I go and hope to find like-minded 
         people in my placement this upcoming Fall semester.
