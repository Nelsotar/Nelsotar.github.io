    <p>If you wish to contact me, the best way is through my LinkedIn profile, or the email I have provided on it.</p>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <h4><a class="contactLink" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarynn/" target="_blank">My LinkedIn Profile</a></h4>
    <p class="linkDesc">This is the best place to learn more about me: my previous experience (both volunteer and work), my skills, and recommendations.</p>
    <h4><a class="contactLink" href="https://github.com/Nelsotar" target="_blank">My GitHub</a></h4>
    <p class="linkDesc">There isn't currently a lot that can be viewed on here as many of my projects are assignments done for school, 
      or modifications on assignments I have done for school. As a result, I have not posted the code publicly for academic integrity reasons.</p>
    <p class="linkDesc">If there is a project you viewed on this site that you would be interested in seeing the code for, 
      please let me know as I would be happy to share.</p>
